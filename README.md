## 🏆 Minimum viable product

* All infrastructure/services you make should be created with infrastructure as code

* Frontend being built, tested and packaged in an automated CI fashion

* Backend being built, tested and packaged in an automated CI fashion

* An automated way of deploying the frontend in either a continuous delivery or continuous deployment fashion.

* An automated way of deploying the backend in either a continuous delivery or continuous deployment fashion.

* A clear, well documented README that guides a reader through the steps required re-create the environment.
    - You can assume the reader has an AWS account
    - You can assume the reader has all the required software installed locally such as Terraform, Kubernetes, kubectl, Helm etc

* A presentation (using whichever presentation tool you wish) that shares:
    - Your ways of working such as how you distributed the work, who took up which responsibilities
    - An visual overview of the architecture and tools you have utilised
    - Any code examples you wish to share
    - Challenges you experienced and how you overcame them

* The presentation should be exported as a PDF and stored within one of your repositories


## 💰 Important notes on costs

* If you have provisioned an EKS cluster, make sure to destroy it when not testing to avoid incurring surplus AWS costs

* For EKS clusters, configure your node groups with a single node. In a non-learning environment you would increase the number of nodes but for this project, in order to save costs, having a single node is absolutely fine.
